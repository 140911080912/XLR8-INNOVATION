# XLR8-INNOVATION
Our XLR8 Story

From designing a 6 wheeler tank, to an ordinary 4 wheeler bot, to suddenly coming up to the idea of a 5 wheeler, was just a gradual and fun procedure. From discussing technicalities to 'zyada se zyada kya hi hoga', from sleeping 10 hours a day to spending sleepless nights in the TL, this experience is unforgettable!
The process was really lively and amusing, whether it be the soldering which needed multiple attempts, or figuring out that one motor is faulty after setting up the whole circuit. Each step had its own insights and takeaways, and we'll all embrace them forever!
Thanks and thanks to all the mentors and team.
